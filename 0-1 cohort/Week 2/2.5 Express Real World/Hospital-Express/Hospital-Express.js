//Express and HTTP with real world examples

// Doctor Example
//In this lecture, we are building a hospital management system or an in memory hospital(i.e without using a database) using Express.js. 
// We implemented GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations for handling patient information. Additionally, we used Postman to test these endpoints.
// We created 4 routes (4 things that the hospital can do)
// 1. GET - Going for a consultation to get check up, User can check how many kidneys they have and their health
// 2. POST - Going to get a new kidney inserted, User can add a new kidney
// 3. PUT - Going to get a kidney replaced, User can replace a kidney, make it healthy
// 4. DELETE - Going to get a kidney removed, User can remove a kidney, remove unhealthy kidenys

// Status codes (using Doctor Logic)
// 1. 200 - Everything went fine
// 2. 404 - Doctor is not in the hospital
// 3. 500 - Mid surgery light went away
// 4. 411 - Inputs were incorrect, wrong person came to surgery
// 5. 403 - You were not allowed or denied access to the hospital
