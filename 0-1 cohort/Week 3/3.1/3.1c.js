// Best Solution : create a middleware and use it in both routes - much more cleaner than 3.1b
//as here the routes(i.e. app.get("/health-checkup-four"..., app.get("/replace-kidney-three"..., app.get("/heart-check"...) now need to only worry about their own application logic and defer all the authentication checks to someone else in some other location altogether (~ these authentication checks here are done by middlewares in the form of function userMiddleware and function kidneyMiddleware)
//so here we have successfully separated the validation logic into reusable middleware functions (userMiddleware and kidneyMiddleware), improving code organization and maintainability when compared to 3.1b
//also here we are passing middleware functions as callback functions to the app.get() method ~ i.e. passing function userMiddleware and function kidneyMiddleware in the form of arguments inside app.get(....)

          // If the validation is successful, call the next middleware function using next(), i.e when next(); is hit next the control reaches inside the function that is right below next

// We can use the middleware functions in other routes as well.
