// Understanding middlewares with help of hospital example during the pandemic season.
// To visit the doctor for a health checkup, a patient would have to undergo some tasks before.
// These tasks include document verification, medical history, BP/Blood/temperature checkups etc.
// Consider these tasks as requests waiting to get processed by the server(hospital staff).
// In terms of code, it would look like:

// Importing the NodeJS module called as ExpressJS to create server.
const express = require("express");
// Create an instance of express server.
const app = express();
// Importing the Zod library for input validation.
const zod = require("zod");

app.get("/health-checkup-one", function (req, res) {
  // Perform the health checkups here and then proceed.
  res.send("You are healthy!");
});

// Now, either we can include the health checkups in the code above itself or
// create separate function for each checkup and then directly call them.
// This is where middlewares come into picture.
// Middlewares are used to perform pre-checks in the program like authentication and user input validation.

// For this example the pre-checks would look like:
// Authentication checks - does the user have enough funds to visit the doctor?
// Input validation - does the user have BP/Blood/temperature checkup reports to show to the doctor.

// Let's add some constraints before proceeding. This will help to understand the need of middlewares.
// User needs to send a kidneyId as a query param which should be a number from 1-2 (humans only have 2 kidneys).
// User should send a username and password in headers.

app.get("/health-checkup-two", function (req, res) {
  // Performing health checkups. These are the inputs.
  const username = req.headers.username;
  const password = req.headers.password;
  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;
  // Username verification for the given inputs.
  if (username != "soni" || password != "pass") {
    res.status(403).json({ msg: "User doesn't exists!" });
    // Early return as we dont want to execute the rest of the code
    // since the user authentication failed.
    return;
  }
  // Input validation for the given inputs.
  if (kidneyId != 1 && kidneyId != 2) {
    res.status(411).json({ msg: "Wrong inputs!" });
    return;
  }

  // If all health checkups are successful.
  res.json({
    msg: "Your kidney is fine!",
  });
});

// Next task is to add a new route that does kidney replacement and the inputs need to be same as the health checkup route.
app.get("/replace-kidney-one", function (req, res) {
  // Performing health checkups. These are the inputs.
  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;
  const username = req.headers.username;
  const password = req.headers.password;
  // Username verification for the given inputs.
  if (username != "soni" || password != "pass") {
    res.status(403).json({
      message: "User doesn't exists!",
    });
    // Early return as we dont want to execute the rest of the code
    // since the user authentication failed.
    return;
  }
  // Input validation for the given inputs.
  if (kidneyId != 1 && kidneyId != 2) {
    res.status(411).json({
      message: "Wrong inputs!",
    });
    return;
  }
  // The kidney replacement logic will be written here.

  // If kidney replacement is successful.
  res.send("Your kidney has been replaced, you are healthy now!");
});

// The above solution for kidney replacement was ugly because of repetition of code.
// The /health-checkup-two code and the /replace-kidney-one look almost similar.
// To make it look better, we can define functions for the common tasks of both routes.

// The username validation and the input validation for kidney appaears same in both routes.
// To avoid writing them again completely, define functions for both separately.
// These functions can then be passed in the request body to make the code look short and better.
// These functions are called the middleware functions.

function usernameValidator(username, password) {
  if (username != "soni" || password != "pass") {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

function kidneyValidator(kidneyId) {
  if (kidneyId != 1 && kidneyId != 2) {
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}

app.get("/health-checkup-three", function (req, res) {
  // Performing health checkups. These are the inputs.
  const username = req.headers.username;
  const password = req.headers.password;
  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;
  // Username verification for the given inputs.
  if (!usernameValidator(username, password)) {
    res.status(403).json({
      message: "User doesn't exists!",
    });
    return;
  }
  // Input validation for the given inputs.
  if (!kidneyValidator(kidneyId)) {
    res.status(411).json({
      message: "Wrong inputs!",
    });
    return;
  }
  // If all health checkups are successful.
  res.json({
    msg: "Your kidney is fine!",
  });
});

app.get("/replace-kidney-two", function (req, res) {
  // Performing health checkups. These are the inputs.
  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;
  const username = req.headers.username;
  const password = req.headers.password;
  // Username verification for the given inputs.
  if (!usernameValidator(username, password)) {
    res.status(403).json({
      message: "User doesn't exists!",
    });
    return;
  }
  // Input validation for the given inputs.
  if (!kidneyValidator(kidneyId)) {
    res.status(411).json({
      message: "Wrong inputs!",
    });
    return;
  }
  // The kidney replacement logic will be written here.

  // If kidney replacement is successful.
  res.send("Your kidney has been replaced, you are healthy now!");
});

// Best Solution : create a middleware and use it in both routes
// To make the above solution more better, we enhance the middleware functions.
// These functions will perform the complete validation and send the response.
// So, the only thing that remains in the request body is the kidney replacement logic and the final response.
// This makes the code more shorter, cleaner and readable.

// While making API requests, we can pass any number of functional parameters.
// These functional parameters work as middlewares to make our work easier.
// The order of the middleware functions is important when writing the code.
// The function which is written first will be executed first.

// While defining a middleware function, the important parameters are request, response and next.
// Request is the HTTP request same that is passed to the API to get the data.
// Response is the HTTP reponse same that is expected to be returned from the API.
// Next is a callback function that is used to call the next middleware function.

function userMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Username verification for the given inputs.
  const username = req.headers.username;
  const password = req.headers.password;
  if (username != "soni" || password != "pass") {
    res.status(403).json({
      message: "User doesn't exists!",
    });
    // Early return as we dont want to execute the rest of the code
    // since the user authentication failed.
    return;
  }
  // If the validation is successful, call the next middleware function.
  next();
}

function kidneyMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  // Input validation for the given inputs.
  const kidneyId = req.query.kidneyId;
  if (kidneyId != 1 && kidneyId != 2) {
    res.status(411).json({
      message: "Wrong inputs!",
    });
    // Early return as we dont want to execute the rest of the code
    // since the user authentication failed.
    return;
  }
  // If the validation is successful, call the next middleware function.
  next();
}

// In the route, we are passing the middleware functions as arguments for the validation tasks.
// Here, first the userMiddleware function will be executed and then the kidneyMiddleware function will execute.
app.get(
  "/health-checkup-four",
  userMiddleware,
  kidneyMiddleware,
  function (req, res) {
    // Do something with kidney here
    res.send("You are healthy!");
  }
);

app.get(
  "/replace-kidney-three",
  userMiddleware,
  kidneyMiddleware,
  function (req, res) {
    // The kidney replacement logic will be written here.

    // If kidney replacement is successful.
    res.send("Your kidney has been replaced, you are healthy now!");
  }
);

// We can use the middleware functions in other routes as well.
// Here, we don't have to pass the kidneyMiddleware function for the heart check.
app.get("/heart-check", userMiddleware, function (req, res) {
  // Do something with user here.
  res.send("Your heart is healthy!");
});

// In above routes, we had passed the middleware functions as arguments.
// If we want to apply a middleware function to all the routes, we can use app.use() function.
// All the middleware functions passed in the app.use() function will be applied for all the routes.

// This middleware helps us to parse the body of the request as a json.
// Generally used to parse the body of POST requests.
app.use(express.json());
// This middleware helps us to parse the body of the request as a url encoded string.
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true }));

// The above two middlewares will be applied to all the routes.

app.get("/health-checkup-five", function (req, res) {
  // Do something with kidney here
  res.send("You are healthy!");
});

// We can add a path to the app.use() function to apply the middleware to only those routes that match the path.
// Let's apply the middleware to all the routes that start with /health-checkup.
app.use("/health-checkup-five", userMiddleware, kidneyMiddleware);

// Global Catches
// The backend servers are hosted on the internet and are accessed by many users.
// They always look for valid input to return the response to the user. But a user can give any type of input and make the server crash.
// The error messages shown by the backend code are quite long and not every user can understand, and it is also not safe to display server information to the user on the frontend.
// To avoid error messages, input validation is needed.
// One way is to use conditionals to check the input type and content.
// But it is a long task because there might be multiple conditionals needed till the server recieves the perfect input.
// Another way is to use global catches. It is a middleware that helps in error handling.
// Global catches should be defined after all the routes so that any time an exception occurs in any route, the Global catches middleware will get called.
// Global catches takes 4 inputs. The extra input is the error message that needs to be shown to the user.

app.use(function (err, req, res, next) {
  res.json({
    msg: "Something's wrong with the server!",
  });
});

// The above global catch was a general example. In real world, multiple checks are needed to be done for the input validation.
// This is where Zod comes into picture. It helps to check user input based on the data type.
// It checks the data type of the input that the server needs and the data type of the user input.
// Using zod makes easy for the developer to perform input validation. The tricky part here is to define the schema.
// First step is to install it and then import it(already done on line 12).

// Next create a schema to define the type of user input.
// Creating a schema for array of numbers.
const schema = zod.array(zod.number());

// To validate the user input, parse it with the schema defined inside the route.
app.post("/health-checkup", function (req, res) {
  // Extract the kidneys values from the input.
  const kidneys = req.body.kidneys;
  // Parse it to compare with schema defined earlier and store the value in response.
  // If the schema type and the data type of the kidneys match, it will return success as true else false.
  const reponse = schema.safeParse(kidneys);
  // If don't match, send response to user stating invalid input.
  if (!response.success) {
    res.status(411).json({
      msg: "Invalid input!",
    });
    return;
    // If match, let the user see what was the response.
  } else {
    res.send({ response });
  }
});

// Running the server on port 3000.
app.listen(3000);


//Extra: Rate Limiting is also part of Middleware concept //Rate Limiting ~ like make sure a single person can only send 5 requests per day
