# Why Languages?
- In the end every programming language converts the high level language 
- Languages are used to write an  application
- The C++ compiler is called g++

# Single Threaded Nature of JS
- You can search about cluster module which will help you to make use of all cores with JS (achieving multithreading)
- In go lang you create something called sub routines. It lets you fork your program.

# JS Objects
- A way to aggregate data
- object.key === object["key"] !== object[key] (In this JS tries to find the key variable and replace it with the string stored inside the variable). Most probably the way variable is replaced is pass by value.

# Callbacks
- Calling functions inside another function is known as callbacks
